### How to Try It With Your Data

1. **Download your Spotify streaming history ZIP**  
   â€¢ If you already have it, just drag-and-drop the ZIP into the app.  
   â€¢ If you donâ€™t, request it here (takes ~3â€“4 weeks):  
   https://support.stats.fm/docs/import/spotify-import/

2. **Upload & Go**  
   â€¢ Once the ZIP arrives, upload it in the sidebar of the live app.  
   â€¢ The dashboard will automatically parse your JSON files, clean them, and surface your personalized listening insights.
